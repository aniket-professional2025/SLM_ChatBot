# SLM_ChatBot
In this project a SLM (Small Language Model) is fine tunned on an open source data available on <https://github.com/poloclub/Fine-tuning-LLMs.git>
The SLM is used to build a ChatBot

To fine tune the SLM using Berger website text, i just copy pasted the text using `ctrl+c` and `ctrl+v` and created separated .txt files to use
